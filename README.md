# BinomialTree

I used the book "Fixed Income Securities" by Pietro Veronesi to test my code.

  -CRR model - Cox, Ross, and Rubinstein (1979)
  -Ho-Lee model
  -Black-Derman-Toy model
  
  
  -Caps (~EU CALL)
  -Floors (~EU PUTS)
  -Swap
  -American
  
  
Finally, I wanted to try to draw graphs.
It was painful but very satisfying in the end. 

I hope this will be useful. 
Any feedback are welcome

Enjoy
